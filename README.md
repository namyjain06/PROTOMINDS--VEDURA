ProtoMinds is a public health support system designed to provide
verified disease awareness, multilingual health guidance, and
location-based early outbreak alerts using messaging platforms like WhatsApp.

ProtoMinds is designed to assist public health authorities,
not to replace doctors or medical professionals.
